This is a simple Sports app where you can choose your favorite sports team and look up their game history using https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php APIs. 

This app is created using MVVM architecture
For dependency injection used Dagger2
For concurrent and asynchronous programming used Coroutines
For Network calling used Retrofit library
For image loading used Glide library
Used also Jetpack components libraries such as ViewBinding, LiveData, ViewModel and NavigationComponent

Furthermore added tracking and analytics using Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics services
For monetization I added AdMob to show banner and Interstitial ads
